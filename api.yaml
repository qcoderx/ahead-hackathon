      description: |-
        Create medical records (encounter, appointments) for a patient via a prompt.
        Include the patient `id` and `prompt` in the request and let Dorra help you detect the type of action
        the prompt is conveying. This endpoint returns the resource detected by Dorra. The available resources are:
        - Appointment
        - Encounter
        - Error: the prompt does not fall within the scope Dorra can handle.


        See the `appointments` and `encounters` sections of this documentation to view the object stucture.


        You can preview the behaviour of this endpoint in the [playground](https://playground.aheadafrica.org).
        Simply type your prompt in the playground and see how Dorra will respond.

        This API enables you to register a webhook to receive events from the PharmaVigillance API.

        The following events are emitted by the webhook

        - `DrugInteraction`

        Below is the event payload format

        ```
        {
            "event": "DrugInteraction",
            "severity": "Moderate",
            "details": "These interactions are clinically significant and may result in an exacerbation of the patient's condition or require a change in therapy.",
            "resource": "Encounter",
            "resource_id": 1,
            "destination_url": <webhook_url>
        }
        ```

        Definition of terms
        ----
        1. `event`: This is the name of the event emitted.

        2. `severity`: This is the level of importance for the event.

            - `Major`: This is a life threatening event.

            - `Moderate`: Interactions may worsen a patient's disease or necessitate a change in therapy, such as a dosage adjustment or increased monitoring.

            - `Minor`: These interactions are minimally clinically significant and primarily limit a drug's clinical effects, potentially increasing the frequency or severity of side effects.

            - `Unknown`: An interaction exists but the information at this time is unknown.

        3. `details`: A breakdown of the event.

        4. `resource`: What type of resource triggered the event. For example, `Encounter`, `Appointment`, `Patient`.

        5. `resource_id`: The primary key of the resource that triggered the event.

        6. `destination_url`: same as the webhook url you register.
